# live_number_recognition
A Deep Learning project using a CNN model to predict hand written digits in real time. 

The model is trained on on the MNIST dataset. What made this more challenging was building a GUI to make predictions in real time as it received hand written number. 

Libraries used: TensorFlow, Keras, Numpy, OpenCV, Matplotlib
